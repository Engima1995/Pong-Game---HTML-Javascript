# Pong

This program was developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

It was developed to test the canvas feature of the new HTML5 markup language as well as understanding the concepts of creating a game without any game engines.

Concepts like collisions, refresh rates was gained throughout the developement of this game. 

It is not the best version but it stills works by allowing 2 players to compete against one another using the following controls:

Player 1 - W and S
Player 2 - Up and Down Arrow Keys

The scores are also added as the ball hits the paddle. If the ball goes beyond the paddle on the x-axis then the player with the highest score wins.
